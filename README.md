## What this is

- A pair of single-file tools you download and run locally in your browser.
- Aeon v4.4: encrypts messages, files, and simple vault entries fully offline.
- MicroVault v1.9: a small, air-gapped-friendly file vault for bundling files into one encrypted JSON.
- Uses standard Web Crypto (AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256) with a human-readable threat model.

## What this isn’t

- Not a cloud service: if you lose the HTML file, the vault, or your passphrase, your data is gone.
- Not protection against malware, keyloggers, or a compromised operating system/browser.
- Not a magic invisibility cloak against powerful, well-resourced attackers.
- Not a substitute for good operational security (strong passphrases, safe devices, and safe habits).
